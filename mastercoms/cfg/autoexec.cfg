// Launch Options:
// -novid -nojoy -noff -nohltv -nod3d9ex
//
// -novid - disables Valve startup logo
// -nojoy - stops Joystick system from starting up
// -noff - disables rumble system
// -nohltv - disables Source TV
// -nod3d9ex - disables some graphical features in dx9 and switching windows may be
//             slower, or crash, but FPS will be increased

// Default config.
exec base // performance improvements and general tweaks that are pretty good

// Additional things. If you don't want them, add a // in front.
exec backpack-tweaks // some backpack UI tweaks that are personal preference
exec hud-tweaks // some HUD tweaks that are personal preference
exec input-tweaks // some input tweaks some people may not like
exec shadow-boost // big boost to shadow rendering but it's a bit of a quality decrease
exec water-no-expensive // water doesn't look as nice, but it's a big performance improvement
exec models-optimized // changes the model quality (LOD offset) to be a good balance between quality and perf
exec textures-optimized // a nice balance between CPU usage (compression) and memory usage (texture quality)

// Variations. If you want them, remove the // at the beginning.
//exec filesystem-ssd // have TF2 make use of your SSD
//exec ragdoll-wait-fade // have ragdolls stay for some time, useful when you have ragdolls physics enabled
//exec ragdoll-physics // enable performance costly ragdoll physics (because they're funny)
//exec textures-no-compression // virtually no CPU usage for compression, but you need a strong GPU
//exec props-draw-details // draw grass and stuff like that, has a performance hit
//exec lighting-rimlight // enable lighting the edge of character models if you prefer it, performance cost though
//exec graphics-weapon-effects // enable some weapons effects like muzzle flashes, shell ejection and bullet lines
//exec particles-increased // don't reduce particle effects, at the cost of performance
//exec pixelvis // enable the costly pixel visibility system. enable on good computers.
//exec decals-disable-overlay // squeeze out some more performance by disabling map decals
//exec ropes-disable // squeeze out a tiny bit of performance by disabling rope rendering
//exec shadows-disable // disable shadows completely
//exec water-potato // make water repulsive and useless but fast
//exec graphics-frame-clear // optimization for tile-based render GPUs (Nvidia GTX 700 series or higher)
//exec opengl // optimizations for OpenGL systems (Linux and Mac)
//exec opengl-page-flipping // if your device supports page flipping, enable this (OpenGL only)

// Finalize config.
exec finish // run some things that should be run last
