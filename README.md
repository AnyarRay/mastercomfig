# tf2cfg
My Team Fortress 2 config, also known as the master comfig.

Download ZIP, and extract the `mastercoms` folder to `GAME_FOLDER/tf/custom`.

Read the first part at the top of `mastercoms/cfg/autoexec.cfg` for more instructions.

Also, look at the Graphical Downgrades section if you have a weak GPU.

## Clean up

If you have already have a config, or want to remove mine, delete any configs you may have in `GAME_FOLDER/tf/custom` and then delete the `GAME_FOLDER/tf/cfg` folder. Then, add `-autoconfig` to the launch options and start Team Fortress 2. Now, at the main menu, quit and then remove the `-autoconfig` launch option.

NOTE: This will reset ALL settings.
