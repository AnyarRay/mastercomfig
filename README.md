# tf2cfg
My Team Fortress 2 config, also known as the master comfig.

This config focuses mainly on improving the experience of the game through
performance optimizations that do not remove much from the game. Instructions
are provided within the config on how to increase or decrease the quality
if you desire.

Download ZIP, and extract the `mastercoms` folder to `GAME_FOLDER/tf/custom` after [cleaning your config](#clean-up).

To get to the `GAME_FOLDER`, right Team Fortress 2 in the Steam games list, click properties, go to the local files tab, and then click the `browse local files...` button.

Read `mastercoms/cfg/autoexec.cfg` for more instructions.

If you're running on Linux or Mac, check out `gl/README.md` for cool tips and tricks.

## Clean up

**NOTE: This will reset ALL settings. Make sure you back up your binds and other
custom settings before you do this.**

If you have already have a config, or want to remove mine, delete any configs you may have in `GAME_FOLDER/tf/custom` and then delete the `GAME_FOLDER/tf/cfg` folder. Next, disable Steam Cloud sync and then verify your game files using Steam.
